            For the girl who's captured every word.

            It's from the heart, a humble release.

            <h3>Her smile, a GUI with perfect UI,
            Her laughter, a debug tool I can't deny.
            In her presence, I'm a lagging CPU,
            Trying to process her, but what can I do?</h3>

            In a realm of pixels and lines of code,
            There's a girl, a bug I can't unload.
            With eyes like pixels, and a smile so bright,
            She's the glitch in my system, disrupting my night.
            
            In her presence, I'm a runtime error,
            Trying to debug, but she's my terror.
            Her beauty's like a buffer overflow,
            Crashing my circuits, my systems go slow.
            
            Oh, how I wish I could refactor my code,
            To impress her, but I'm stuck in debug mode.
            So here's a poem, a software engineer's plea,
            For the girl who's got my CPU at ninety degrees.
            
            It may not compile, it may have a flaw,
            But it's from the heart, a programmer's faux pas.

            With her smile like an API call,
            She's the exception that breaks my firewall.</h3>
            <h1>So here's to debugging this SOMETHING.exe file,
            With humor and laughter, and a sprinkle of style.
            For the girl who's got my CPU overclocked,
            Let's hope this code doesn't get blocked..... It may not pass all my unit tests,
            But it's from the kernal, where my Operating System rests.</h1>
